# Introduction

> Typography is the art and technique of arranging type.

^ The goal is making written language legible, readable, and appealing
^ Our primary focus in this presentation will be Western type.
^ However, a quick shout-out to:

---

## The Role of Good Type

1. Attract and hold the audience’s attention
2. Be friendly to the reader
3. Establish an information hierarchy
4. Helps to create harmony
5. Creates and build brand recognition

## "Font" vs "Typeface"

^ Get this out of the way now.
^ A typeface is a family of fonts sharing common design features

---

^ A font is an alphabet and its associated characters in single style (and historically size).
^ Examples:

^ Written word has evolved over several millennia
^ Good type does not only result in an aesthetic appeal but reduces the void between man and machine.

## Classification of Type

^ classification describes typefaces; it does not define them
^ subjective and incomplete, many systems exist

---

### Serif and Sans Serif

^ Primary two classifications

![original inline](https://candelita.is/new_site/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/serif-vs-sans-serif-typography-selection-1024x522-1.jpg)

---

## Serifs

---

## Humanist / Old-Style

^ strong calligraphic influence
^ This Adobe Garamond
^ low contrast between thick and thin lines
^ Diagonal stress

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Garamond_sample.svg/1280px-Garamond_sample.svg.png)

---

## Transitional

^ More pronounced contrast
^ More vertical stress
^ This is Times New Roman

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Times_New_Roman_sample.svg/500px-Times_New_Roman_sample.svg.png)

---

## Modern

^ Very strong contrast
^ vertical stress
^ Bodini

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Bodoni_sample.svg/440px-Bodoni_sample.svg.png)

---

#### Egyptian / Slab

^ This serifs, often as thick as other strokes
^ Clarendon

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Clarendon_sample.svg/580px-Clarendon_sample.svg.png)

---

### Sans Serifs

^ No serifs
^ Almost always a vertical axis

---

#### Grotesque

^ Very awkward, many of the original typefaces consisted only of capital letters

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/FranklinGothic.svg/876px-FranklinGothic.svg.png)

---

#### Neo-Grotesque / Realist

^ much less variation in line weight
^ single-story "a" and "g"
^ Univers, Helvetica
^ simplicity does not directly translate into legibility
^ tight vertical rhythm and pinched apertures keep many (including Helvetica) from being good choices for body text

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Helvetica.svg/440px-Helvetica.svg.png)

---

#### Humanist

^ strong calligraphic influence
^ stroke contrast
^ slanted axis, or "stress"
^ double-story "a" and "g"
^ improved legibility

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Syntax_example.png/440px-Syntax_example.png)

---

#### Geometric

^ Derived from geometric shapes rather than handwriting
^ circular bowls, very rectangular
^ Many common components between glyphs
^ Futura

![original inline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Futura.svg/440px-Futura.svg.png)

---

## Practical Editing

^ One of the most important ways we can use typography, is how we interact with type every day, in our programming environments.

---

### Monospace Type

^ aka Fixed-width
^ Most type designs are proportional in width

^ Pros
^ Alignment is the most important reason we use mono-spaced fonts in programming
^ Dot-matrix printers and type writers produced fixed width type
^ Early terminals were fixed to 80 characters wide
^ Improved legibility for the small symbols frequently used as operators

^ Cons
^ Reduced legibility for prose

### Legibility

^ Typefaces designed specifically for programming will include legibility improvements:
^ 0 O o
^ I, i, l, 1

---

^ Distinctive braces and brackets
^ carefully designed letters that are normally thin to compensate for lack of kerning
^ Operator Mono

^ Ligatures
^ Many of the multi-character operators we use in programming are derived from the more complex typographic glyphs (often mathematical)
 simplified for typing on a standard keyboard.
^ OpenType format and modern editors allow us to present these characters with beautiful ligatures.
^ Some fonts include:

### Syntax Highlighting

^ colors are applied to words known ahead of time (language keywords), and operators, symbols, and other syntactic elements of code
^ highlight on language-specific keywords, operators and similar elements, which have the same meaning in anyone's code
^ It can only highlight by what the code _looks like_, but not what the code _means_

---

### Semantic Highlighting

^ instead of the built-in keywords being highlighted, everything else is.
^ attempts to parse out what's important about _your_ code -- what it means
^ Each keyword or variable name has its own color
^ At a glance, it becomes easy to follow data through the code

^ Personal Editor Setup
^ A mix of four fonts
^ Inverted comments
^ Ligatures for symbols
^ Mix of weight and italics for different keywords and constants
^ Reduced opacity of unimportant symbols

## Type for the Web

---

### History

![inline](http://history-computer.com/Internet/images/MosaicForWindows.gif)

---

#### Font Tag

^ Not until HTML 3.2 in 1995
^ Font had to be installed on the computer or a fall back was used

```HTML
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><I>© 1994 <B>www.twaxdotcom.com</B>
All Rgihts Reserved.</I></FONT></P>
```

---

^ CSS
^ 1996, provided same functionality as the font tag

![](http://bentobyte.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15-Y9yy9Hi-800x500.jpg)

---

#### Web-safe fonts

^ Likely to be present on a wide range of computer systems

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Century Gothic", CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-style: normal;
  font-variant: normal;
  font-weight: 500;
  line-height: 26.4px;
}
```

---

^ Microsoft's Core fonts for the Web
^ Originally: Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, Impact, Georgia, Trebuchet, Webdings and Verdana
^ Defacto fonts for the web, despite not being present on most Mac and Linux systems

---

#### CSS3

^ CSS2 Attempted to include a specification for font downloading, removed in CSS2.1
^ fonts module, widely used today, greatly improved web typography

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Fooberry';
  src: url('/fonts/fooberry.woff') format('woff'),
       url('/fonts/fooberry.svg#Fooberry') format('svg'),
       url('/fonts/fooberry.ttf') format('truetype'),
       url('/fonts/fooberry.eot'),
       url('/fonts/fooberry.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

---

### Selection & Pairing

---

^ We're not Designers
^ Don't try to be, if you aren't comfortable with it
^ Use recommended pairings, like wine with foods
^ Search for inspiration and borrow / steal it
^ No need to re-invent the wheel here

![](./assets/google-fonts.png)

---

^ Rules of Thumb
^ Plenty of variety in the variants of a single family
^ If there's not enough variety there, two typefaces is probably enough, one serif, one sans
^ In _print_ Sans Serif is often used for display text, and serifs for body text.
^ In modern web design, this isn't always true, again look to recommendations if you aren't sure

### Unity in Variety

> a principle that aesthetic value or beauty in art depends on the fusion of various elements into an organic whole which produces a single impression
-- MERRIAM-WEBSTER

---

^ Hokusai, “The Great Wave off Shore at Kanagawa”
^ repetitions of shapes to create chaos
^ Whitecaps on the waves in the foreground mimic the snow atop Mount Fuji in the distance
^ Carefully arranged solids and voids in his composition to create opposing but balancing areas of interest.
^ the two areas compete for attention, neither possible without the other
^ Apply this to type by looking for typefaces that have some similar qualities but also create complimentary contrast

### Grid Systems

^ Difficult to a achieve fully aligned 2D grids in CSS
^ until now, CSS grid layouts will help this
^ Choose a Baseline Size
^ Use multiples of them as much as possible
^ Whitespace, gutters, leading aka padding/margins
^ Sass helps with this

![original fit](http://thinkingwithtype.com/images/Thinking_with_Type_Grid_11.gif)

---

### Vertical Rhythm

^ keeping vertical spaces between elements on a page consistent with each other.

![original fit](http://typographyhandbook.com/assets/images/baseline-grid.png)

---

### Hierarchy

^ Look at what you are trying to say and assign a hierarchy of information to it using size, scale and color.
^ Use things like borders and shadows to add variety to certain elements
^ Use the same border style, use the same shadow size, color, radius
^ Again, Sass helps with this

![inline](http://typecast.com/images/uploads/hierarchy.png)

---

### Performance Considerations

---

#### Download Time

^ Yes, this is still a thing.
^ Too many fonts in addition to throwing a design into chaos also dramatically impact performance
^ When selecting fonts from Google, pay attention to the meter
^ Google fonts also gives you the benefit of common fonts likely being cached
^ Use Chrome Dev tools
^ Download budget

^ Any Questions?
